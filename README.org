* Introduction
This is a clojure library designed to extend the clojure syntax 
so it can load org file as source file directly.

The implementation details of [[https://github.com/jingtaozf/literate-clojure][literate-clojure]] is in file [[./src/literate_clojure/core.org][core.org]] ([[./src/literate_clojure/core.pdf][pdf version]]).

This library is provided to make litrate programming more happy in clojure,without
pain of tangling code from org files.

* Usage
To use this library, please add dependence in your [[./demo/project.clj][project.clj]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]
                 [literate-clojure "0.0.1"]]
#+END_SRC

Then in one of your [[./demo/src/demo/core.clj][source file]],add the following codes to install the org syntax for clojure reader:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require 'literate-clojure.core)
(literate-clojure.core/install-org-dispatcher)
(load-file "src/demo/core.org")
#+END_SRC
Now you can use [[./demo/src/demo/core.org][core.org]] to write your documentation and source codes together,
and any codes in [[./demo/src/demo/core.org][core.org]] will be loaded automatically.

The org files must start with a sharp and a space, for example I usually add the following line
to the beginning of an org file:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
# -*- encoding:utf-8 Mode: POLY-ORG;  -*- --- 
#+END_SRC
It will use Emacs library [[https://github.com/polymode/poly-org][poly-org-mode]] which is a lightweight library 
to support multiple major mode in one file,
so you can edit clojure code natively in an org file.
